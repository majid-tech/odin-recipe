    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck.</p>

     <p> It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>

     <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

       <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and </p>
            <p>a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes.</p>
            <p>The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</p>
            <p> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix</p>
            <p>of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of</p>
            <p>noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you</p>
            <p>have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</p>
        </li>
       </ol>
